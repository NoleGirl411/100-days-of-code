### Day 2: June 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Portfolio website project that's a part of FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development Curriculum. 

**Thoughts**: I get stuck on style decisions. I'm not sure if it's a product of wanting it to look perfect or not knowing what will look good until I make the changes. I should probably find one that I like and model mine after it.

### Day 3: June 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Portfolio website project and the javascript portion of FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development Curriculum. 

**Thoughts**: I scrapped the navigation I had in favor for a simpler look. Going back to the javascript track to keep my momentum going.
